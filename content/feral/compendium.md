## 10.2 News
### Tier Set
> 2p: {{< spell 274838 "Feral Frenzy" >}} grants {{< spell 422751 "Smoldering Frenzy" >}}, increasing all damage you deal by 20% for 8 seconds.

> 4p: {{< spell 274838 "Feral Frenzy's" >}} cooldown is reduced by 15 seconds. During {{< spell 422751 "Smoldering Frenzy" >}}, enemies burn for 10% of damage you deal as Fire over 10 seconds.

This ends up being roughly a ~13% dps gain over no tier. Due to the item level increase going into next tier, its very possible that you'll want to ditch 10.1 4 piece and go with 2+2. You should sim this when you get to that point though. You'll want to get to 10.2 4 piece asap of course. 

Also, its not the cast of {{< spell 274838 "Feral Frenzy" >}} that grants {{< spell 422751 "Smoldering Frenzy" >}}, it is the direct damage hits (aka the 5 ticks that give you combo points). This means when you use {{< spell 274838 "Feral Frenzy" >}}, it refreshes back to 8 seconds 5 times over roughly a second, resulting in the buff lasting just under 9s in total. {{< spell 274838 "Feral Frenzy's" >}} casted by {{< spell 391528  "Convoke" >}} also proc this effect.

### List of changes

**{{< spell 391881 "Apex Predator's Craving" >}}:**
{{< spell 1079 "Rip" >}} ticks have a 7.2% (was 4%) chance in single target to make next bite free. This chance now gets reduced as {{< spell 1079 "Ripped" >}} targets increases. This comes out to be a gain below 4 targets, and a loss at 4+ targets.

**{{< spell 421442 "Ashamane's Guidance (Incarnation)" >}} is reworked:**
During {{< spell 102543 "Incarnation" >}} and for 30 seconds afterwards, {{< spell 1079 "Rip" >}} and {{< spell 1822 "Rake" >}} cause affected enemies to take 3% increased damage from your abilities. This stacks, coming out to a little over 6% damage taken debuff. This is just strictly worse than {{< spell 390902 "Carnivorous Instincts" >}} and will never be played at its current tuning.

**{{< spell 421432 "Saber Jaws" >}} has been added to replace Cat's Curiosity:** 
- Rank 1: When you spend extra Energy on {{< spell 22568 "Ferocious Bite" >}}, the extra damage is increased by 40%.<br>
- Rank 2: When you spend extra Energy on {{< spell 22568 "Ferocious Bite" >}}, the extra damage is increased by 80%.

Since this only buffs the extra damage portion of bite, at max energy the total damage of {{< spell 22568 "Ferocious Bite" >}} is increased by 20/40%. This does NOT work on free bites from {{< spell 391528  "Convoke" >}} or {{< spell 391881 "Apex Predator's Craving" >}}.

**{{< spell 393771 "Relentless Predator" >}}:**
Instead of reducing the cost of {{< spell 22568 "Ferocious Bite" >}} by 20%, this now reduces its cost by 10%. This effectively kills the talent in all situations. I am expecting this node to be replaced in a future patch.

**{{< spell 391709 "Rampant Ferocity" >}}:**
This got buffed by 10%. Nothing changes about when you select this talent, as the aformentioned {{< spell 391881 "Apex Predator's Craving" >}} nerf at larger target counts hurt the effectiveness of Rampant Ferocity.

**{{< spell 29166 "Innervate" >}}:** is now castable in Cat Form. Rejoice.

# [2.Rotation:](#rotation)

</div>

**What is a priority list?**

When reading the priority lists below, you should not think about these as steps to follow in a specific order. At any given point in combat, you should cast the first thing in the list that you are able to cast. As such, you will note that there are some abilities included in the priority lists below that are not chosen as talents in the recommended build. This is not a mistake, but simply indicates the priority of that ability IF you happened to take it for whatever reason. The presence of an ability in a priority list does not mean that you should be talenting into or using that ability, these lines are simply there for completeness. If the length of these lists feels daunting, one might recommend copying them to a separate document and removing lines that do not apply to you, thus making the list a bit more compact.

The way this section is written is very formulaic and has the same structure as the Action Priority List (APL) used in sims. If you need a more digestable format, try [WoWhead's guide](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/classes/druid/feral/rotation-cooldowns-pve-dps#single-target) written by Guilty
<div id="precombat">

## [Pre-combat](#precombat)

</div>

**Pre-Combat:**
- Use {{< spell 319454 "Heart of the Wild" >}}
- Use {{< spell 102547 "Prowl" >}}
- Use {{< spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury" >}}
- Use {{< spell 1822 "Rake" >}} from stealth.

<div id="st">

## [Single Target priority](#st)

</div>

**Single Target priority list:**

- Use {{< spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury" >}} if any of the following conditions are met
    - {{< spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury" >}} is not up.
    - You are more than 65 energy from the cap.
    - You have 10.2 2 piece set bonus equipped, and {{< spell 274838 "Feral Frenzy" >}} is ready to be used.
    - You've talented {{< spell 391528  "Convoke the Spirits" >}} and do not have 10.2 tier set equipped. <br> (Using it on CD keeps {{< spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury" >}} and {{< spell 391528  "Convoke" >}} aligned.)
- Without {{< spell 391951 "Unbridled Swarm" >}} talented, use {{< spell 391889 "Adaptive Swarm" >}} when all of these conditions are met:
    - There isn't an {{< spell 391889 "Adaptive Swarm" >}} heading to an enemy target.
    - {{< spell 391889 "Adaptive Swarm" >}} is either not up or it is about to expire with 1 or 2 stacks.
- With {{< spell 391951 "Unbridled Swarm" >}} talented, the conditions change based on the amount of {{< spell 391889 "Adaptive Swarms" >}} you have out:
    - If you have 3 {{< spell 391889 "Adaptive Swarms" >}} with at least 2 stacks out then you will target allies with priority 1 stack > 0 stack > 2 stacks.
    - If you have 2 or fewer {{< spell 391889 "Adaptive Swarms" >}} of at least 2 stacks, cast on your enemy target when swarm is not on them, and is not traveling towards them.
- Use {{< spell 102543 "Incarnation" >}} if it's ready.
- Use {{< spell 106951 "Berserk" >}} if it's ready. 
    - If you're playing 2 minute {{< spell 391528  "Convoke" >}}, you can instead hold {{< spell 106951 "Berserk" >}} for {{< spell 391528  "Convoke" >}} where fight timers are good to do so, especially if you have [Ashes of the Embersoul](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=207167/ashes-of-the-embersoul), [Witherbark's Branch](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=109999/witherbarks-branch), or will be buffed by an Augmentation Evoker every 2 minutes. Additionally, its always a gain regardless of talents and equipment to line up your last Berserk with a convoke cast if possible.
- Use {{< spell 391528  "Convoke" >}} if all of the following conditions are met:
    - Rip will not fall off during Convoke's channel.
    - Tiger's Fury is up.
    - Smoldering Frenzy is up or you do not have 10.2 4 piece set bonus equipped.
    - You have 0 or 1 combo points OR Smoldering Frenzy would fall off before Convoke ends.
- Use {{< spell 274838 "Feral Frenzy" >}} if all of the following conditions are met:
    - {{< spell 417710 "Dire Fixation" >}} (if talented) is applied to the target.
    - You have less than 2 combo points and are not in {{< spell 102543 "Incarn" >}}/{{< spell 106951 "Berserk" >}}, or under 3 combo points during {{< spell 102543 "Incarn" >}}/{{< spell 106951 "Berserk" >}}.
- Use {{< spell 22568 "Ferocious Bite" >}} if you have a {{< spell 391881 "Apex Predator's Craving" >}} proc.

**If you are in Berserk see [here](#berserk) as your priorities from this point on change a bit.**

    - {{< spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury" >}} is up, or won't be up before {{< spell 1079 "Rip" >}} expires.

## [Raid Talents](#raidtalents)
</div>

### T30 4pc 10.2 Talent Builds (Aberrus tier-set)
For the first week or two of the season while still wearing old tier set.

[T30 Single-Target](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/druid/feral/DARAUEEBCQpCFREExhUQBBOVBAZRUVFViURBQBF)
<br>[T30 Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/druid/feral/DARAUEEBCQpCFREExhUQBBOVFAZREVFVaRRAQCBU)
<br>[T30 Sustained Cleave/AoE](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/druid/feral/DARAUEEBCQZCFRUExhUQBBOVRURRQVFVYRVBQCFE)
- Drop a point in {{< spell 383352 "Tireless Energy" >}} or {{< spell 48484 "Infected Wounds" >}} if you need {{< spell 285381 "Primal Wrath" >}} in either of these builds for fights with adds.
- Note: it is preferable if you can farm an on-use stat trinket for the burst build. 
### 2pc+2pc Talent Builds
- Plays the same builds as T30, except you can swap a point in {{< spell 390902 "Carnivorous Instincts" >}} to {{< spell 391889 "Adaptive Swarm" >}} for the burst and cleave builds for a small gain if you want.
- As mentioned earlier, you should sim your character to see if it's worth going to 2pc 2pc: generally it is worth due to the item level gain, but will vary e.g. tier from LFR or lower M+ catalyst vs Heroic raid.

- *Specific boss talents coming soon, let your mind cook with these foundations.
- Note: generally best to play 'Standard Convoke' for single-target, assuming you have an on-use trinket like Witherbark's. They sim equally, however Convoke offers more burst, and pulls ahead with Augmentation buffing you. Kill timers can also play a factor; if you are unsure, stick to Convoke. If you do play L/R, Infected Wounds can optionally be swapped for Lunar Inspiration with T31 as well.

<div id="raidcustomisation">
 
### [T31 Raid Talent Customisation](#raidcustomisation)

</div>

In the first two gates, you can freely swap between {{< spell 231063 "Merciless Claws" >}}, {{< spell 383352 "Tireless Energy" >}}, {{< spell 48484 "Infected Wounds" >}}, and {{< spell 285381 "Primal Wrath" >}}, based on what you need.
- {{< spell 231063 "Merciless Claws" >}} is the strongest burst option of these nodes, and only slightly behind in sustained single-target and cleave.
- {{< spell 48484 "Infected Wounds" >}} for stronger sustained single-target, or if multi-dotting with Rake.
- {{< spell 383352 "Tireless Energy" >}} for strong single-target and solid in cleave and AoE, but weaker for burst. You should also adjust points if you are overcapping energy via {{< spell 391881 "Apex" >}} procs or downtime due to mechanics. 
- {{< spell 285381 "Primal Wrath" >}} if there are regular adds that need to die, or adds that can provide funnel opportunities with {{< spell 391881 "Apex" >}}.
- Note: {{< spell 391785 "Tear Open Wounds" >}} and {{< spell 391700 "Double-Clawed Rake" >}} are additional options particularly for sustained AoE/cleave (Council), or if your raid is struggling with certain adds. 

Final gate options: swap between {{< spell 390902 "Carnivorous Instincts" >}}, {{< spell 400320 "Circle of Life and Death" >}}, {{< spell 421432 "Saber Jaws" >}}, {{< spell 391347 "Rip & Tear" >}}, 1 minute {{< spell 391548  "Convoke the Spirits" >}}, and {{< spell 391889 "Swarm" >}}, as needed.
- {{< spell 400320 "Circle" >}}: generally worth grabbing if taking {{< spell 285381 "Primal Wrath" >}} with {{< spell 391881 "Apex" >}}, or if there's a lot of multi-dot potential.
- {{< spell 390902 "Carnivorous Instincts" >}}: strong burst, with good single-target and AoE. Predator resets and high Tiger's Fury uptime add value here.
- {{< spell 421432 "Saber Jaws" >}}: strong single-target pathing option to {{< spell 391881 "Apex" >}}. 
- {{< spell 391347 "Rip & Tear" >}}: cleave and AoE pathing option to {{< spell 391881 "Apex" >}}, not too far behind on single-target vs Saber Jaws with Convoke as it lets you spend another point elsewhere.
- 1m {{< spell 391548  "Convoke the Spirits" >}}: if you need more frequent burst, or just a gambling addict. Kill times will play a significant factor and whether your raids kill time aligns better with the cooldown of 2 minute Convoke (even e.g. 4.31) vs 1 minute Convoke (odd e.g. 5.31).
- {{< spell 391889 "Swarm" >}}: incredibly strong single-target synergy with tier-set, can drop at times for heavy AoE.

<div id="m+">
 
### [M+ Talent Customisation](#m+)

</div>

{{< figure src="/feral/classtreem+.png" >}}

Note: for Feral, the talents in the first two gates have similar power-levels, and you can freely distribute extra points how you please here, up until you have spent 20 points. The final gate has stronger nodes and you should always spend the maximum points possible here (10).

Options for the first two gates:
- {{< spell 391700 "Double-Clawed Rake" >}} -> {{< spell 391709 "Rampant Ferocity" >}}: this comes down to pull size; DCR particularly excels in low and medium (pug) size pulls and is generally the better choice, however RF can pull ahead with large pulls e.g. in a dungeon with dense trash or with an organised group doing consistent triple~ pulls.
- {{< spell 391700 "Double-Clawed Rake" >}} -> {{< spell 384665 "Taste for Blood" >}}: if you want more single target, TFB is a great option e.g. for Tyrannical weeks, while also providing some funnel value on trash.
- {{< spell 391785 "Tear Open Wounds" >}} -> {{< spell 391709 "Rampant Ferocity" >}}: if your goal is purely to funnel, you can change to RF and spend your finishers on Bite while only using {{< spell 285381 "Primal Wrath" >}} to maintain Rip in AoE. This is somewhat more advanced with more consideration for energy and combo points, and requires you to break 'primal wrath spam' muscle memory.
- {{< spell 48484 "Infected Wounds" >}} -> {{< spell 384665 "Taste for Blood" >}}: if you are not running Double-clawed Rake, Taste for Blood is a great option that offers a prominent single target gain over Infected Wounds this patch as a result of the {{< spell 391881 "Apex" >}} changes. Even moreso if running {{< spell 391528  "Convoke the Spirits" >}}.

Options for the final gate:
- {{< spell 319439 "Bloodtalons" >}} vs {{< spell 391972 "Lion's Strength" >}}: in 10.2, BT gains a lot of quality of life when changing to the new tier-set, in addition to the {{< spell 391881 "Apex" >}} change with procs slowing down slightly in AoE. This combined with the 10.1 change of 3 charges makes BT feel smooth to play in season 3 M+. However, Lion's Strength is still a competitive option and only a small DPS loss while allowing you to focus on other things. If you are fairly new to Feral, you should start with Lion's Strength and swap to Bloodtalons when you have learnt everything else.
- {{< spell 391528  "Convoke the Spirits" >}} vs {{< spell 102543 "Incarnation" >}}: both talents are equally viable and will depend on your talents, gear, dungeon, and own preference. Convoke is very strong with Witherbark's Branch or similar on-use trinkets, and similarly should be played if dropping Rake talents such as Infected Wounds (as Incarn wants Rake talents), while Incarn can pull ahead with larger pulls. These two options are interchangeable though and there is no all-round 'best.' 
- 1 min {{< spell 391548  "Convoke" >}}: generally worse than 2m, however is a competitive option if running {{< spell 391709 "Rampant Ferocity" >}}. Drop Carnivorous Instincts/Swarm for it.
- {{< spell 390902 "Carnivorous Instincts" >}} vs {{< spell 391889 "Swarm" >}}: CI is your 'safe' all-round good pick, however Swarm is a very strong single-target option and should be considered for Tyrannical.
- {{< spell 391951 "Unbridled Swarm" >}}: for a talent that undersims, this is simming competitively with the more standard builds. In other words: this is looking to be very, very good this patch. Take in medium pull size dungeons.
- Honourable mention: {{< spell 391978 "Veinripper" >}} can be a good funnel option if playing a {{< spell 391709 "Rampant Ferocity" >}}-focused build and focusing on ethical prio-damage.

<div id="m+classtree">
 
### [M+ Class Tree](#m+classtree)

</div>

{{< figure src="/feral/druidtreem+.png" >}}

The druid tree offers a fair degree of customisation as Feral in M+, with a range of utility and defensive options. What is selected (yellow) is mandatory, with blue nodes being your options based on affixes or personal preference. 

- {{< spell 2782  "Remove Corruption" >}} for Afflicted weeks. Additionally, the following dungeons have poison and curse dispels: Atal'Dazar, Darkheart Thicket, Throne of the Tides, and Waycrest Manor.
- {{< spell 2637  "Hibernate" >}} for Incorporeal weeks.
- {{< spell 391528  "Nature's Vigil" >}} is still very strong in AoE, and will often keep you alive or minimise the need to Regrowth on big pulls, increasing your DPS. Over the dungeon it usually does more personal healing to you than any other talent, while also healing your group mates. Macro to Berserk/Incarn. 
- {{< spell 378986  "Protector of the Pack" >}} is a strong self-healing node for Feral, and gains even more value if you can occasionally utilise it to heal your group as well.
- {{< spell 33873  "Nurturing Instinct" >}} should only be considered if Beekeeping for small DPS and HPS gains.
- {{< spell 131768  "Feline Swiftness" >}} is commonly dropped in high-end for more defensives and utility, as Catform gives 30% speed baseline which is more than enough for dungeon mechanics. If uncomfortable, try only dropping 1 point at first to retain 8%.
- {{< spell 377842  "Ursine Vigor" >}} is more of a high-key talent to survive one-shots.

## [Phials](#Phials)

Phials:

- [Iced Phial of Corrupting Rage](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191329/iced-phial-of-corrupting-rage): Default phial unless the fight has too high damage intake or you are at risk of dying.
- [Phial of Tepid Versatility](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191341/phial-of-tepid-versatility): Recommended phial if the fight has high damage intake or you are at risk of dying.
- [Phial of Elemental Chaos](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191359/phial-of-elemental-chaos): Generally similar dps throughput as Tepid Versatility, but less defensive benefits. 

<br><div id="runes">

## [Runes](#Runes)

</div>

I apologize for being annoying but, sim your character for the most accurate answer. Generally {{< spell 391528  "Convoke" >}} builds do not want to play [Howling Rune](https://www.wowhead.com/item=194819/howling-rune) in single target if that is any consolation-but even that's not a guarantee. Make sure you select Rune (stat) (Main Hand) else it may not sim properly. ie: Buzzing (Crit) (Main Hand). Crit is the default setting.

## [Embellishments](#embellishments)

</div>

For Embellishments we craft 2x [Shadowflame-Tempered Armor Patch](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=204710/shadowflame-tempered-armor-patch). Once you have all of your gems, [Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193001/elemental-lariat) will replace one of your [Shadowflame-Tempered Armor Patch](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=204710/shadowflame-tempered-armor-patch) slots.

**Crafting order**

- Sim yourself to see which leather armor slot best pairs with [Shadowflame-Tempered Armor Patch](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=204710/shadowflame-tempered-armor-patch). If you refuse to sim, put it on cloak or bracers, whichever is lower item level for you.
- Sim yourself for all non-embellished crafts on [Raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/droptimizer). Rings are particularly notable early on due to them coming with a socket already applied.

I would recommend holding your 1st craft for as long as possible. It's not unusual for blizzard to tune as late as during the first couple days of raid release. Of course, I can't stop you if you decide to craft early, but do note that you may craft suboptimally if you do so. Would be a shame if snowball makers suddenly got a 100% buff.

Please use Top Gear or Droptimizer on [Raidbots](https://raidbots.com) in order to decide what trinkets to use/farm, but the following list should give you a good idea of some of the trinkets you will want to look out for. The list is in roughly power-level order assuming the highest item level versions of the trinkets. Acquire [Witherbark's Branch](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=109999/witherbarks-branch?bonus=4795&class=11&ilvl=489&spec=103) asap.
### To use in Raid

- [Witherbark's Branch](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=109999/witherbarks-branch?bonus=4795&class=11&ilvl=489&spec=103)

### To use in Dungeons

- [Witherbark's Branch](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=109999/witherbarks-branch?bonus=4795&class=11&ilvl=489&spec=103)
- [Pip's Emerald Friendship Badge](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=207168/pips-emerald-friendship-badge?bonus=4795&class=11&ilvl=489&spec=103)

- [Coiled Serpent Idol](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=207175/coiled-serpent-idol?bonus=4795&class=11&ilvl=489&spec=103)

In a clean run where there isn't a lot of downtime between pulls, this becomes competitive with the top end trinkets.

# [6. Miscellaneous:](#misc)

<div id="snapshot">

## [What is snapshotting?](#snapshot)

</div>

Snapshotting is when a buff that is present when a bleed is applied is maintained over the duration of the bleed, as opposed to buffing dots while the buff is up. For instance, if you {{< spell 1822 "Rake" >}} a target, and then press {{< spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury" >}}, the {{< spell 1822 "Rake" >}} will not be buffed by {{< spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury" >}}. However, if you {{< spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury" >}} and then {{< spell 1822 "Rake" >}}, that {{< spell 1822 "Rake" >}} will be amplified by {{< spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury" >}} even after {{< spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury" >}} falls off.

Rake snapshots {{< spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury" >}} and Stealth (including {{< spell 384667 "Sudden Ambush" >}}, see: {{< spell 390772 "Pouncing Strikes" >}})
<br>Rip snapshots {{< spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury" >}} and {{< spell 319439 "Bloodtalons" >}}
<br>Thrash snapshots {{< spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury" >}} and {{< spell 236068 "Moment of Clarity">}}
<br>Moonfire (Lunar Inspiration) snapshots {{< spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury" >}}

If you have a Weakaura that tracks snapshot strength, it works as follows:
<br>Green/higher than 100: Reapplying the bleed now would make it stronger
<br>Grey/100: Reapplying the bleed now would keep it the same strength
<br>Red/lower than 100: Reapplying the bleed now would make it weaker

Generally you try to maintain the strongest bleeds you can as much as possible, and the rotation above reflects this.

<br><div id="pandemic">

## [What does pandemic refer to?](#pandemic)

</div>

Pandemic is a mechanic that most damage-over-time spells have. When you cast a damage-over-time spell such as Rake while it's already applied to the target, the dots duration gets extended by the amount of time remaining on the dot. This extension is capped to 30% of the dots duration. For example, lets say you have a dot that has a 10 second duration. If you recast this dot while it has 2 seconds left, its new duration is 12 seconds. If you recast it again while it has 8 seconds left, its new duration is 13 seconds, because 30% of 10 seconds is 3 seconds. Pandemic got its name from an old warlock passive with the same effect, before it became a baseline feature of damage-over-time spells.

<br><div id="macros">

## [Macros](#macros)

</div>
None of these macros are required by any means, just a few that can be useful for some people.

**Regrowth in Cat Form macro:**

```
#showtooltip Regrowth
/run if InCombatLockdown() then SetCVar("autounshift",0) end
/cast [@mouseover, help] [help] [@player] Regrowth
/console autounshift 1
```

**Macro combining Lunar Inspiration {{< spell 155625 "Moonfire" >}} and {{< spell 391528  "Convoke" >}} to one bind:**

```
#showtooltip
/cast [known: Lunar Inspiration] Moonfire; [known: Convoke the Spirits] Convoke the Spirits
```
The idea behind this macro is that there are no talent builds that play both of these things.

**Ursol's Vortex @cursor macro:**

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@cursor] Ursol's Vortex
```

**Trinket macro:**

If you are using an on-use trinket/weapon that should go along with your cooldowns, use the following macro: (/13 for top trinket slot, /14 for bottom trinket slot and /16 for weapon.)
```
#showtooltip
/use 13
/use 14
/use 16
/cast Berserk
```

**Entangling Roots macro:**

Casts Entangling Roots on a target you mouseover, otherwise casts on current target if no mouseover.
```
#showtooltip Entangling Roots
/cast [@mouseover, harm, nodead][] Entangling Roots
```

**Focus Skull Bash:**

Casts Skull Bash at your focus target. Remember to bind focus target in WoW keybind settings.
```
#showtooltip skull bash
/cast [@focus] skull bash
```

**Adaptive Swarm macro:**

Casts Swarm on your current target, or a friendly if you mouseover them. This can be applied to numerous abilities you cast on allies (Dispel, Rejuv/Regrowth, Innervate etc to save on keybinds), as seen in the Rebirth macro further below. 
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, help] [] Adaptive Swarm; [@target, harm] Adaptive Swarm 
```

**Rebirth/Other Macro:**

Casts Rebirth when you mouseover a friendly, or otherwise Mark of the Wild. Customise these macros how you please. 
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, help] Rebirth; Mark of the Wild
```
